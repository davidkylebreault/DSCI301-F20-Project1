```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

I see your graph is running out of room for the labels.  Adjusting these is a little tricky (it might work better with a `coord_flip`), but here's an attempt using a `theme` (we haven't discussed this yet) to adjust the angle and justification of the label text so they can fit on:

```{r, message = F}
source("CleanData.R")
zoo.final %>%
  group_by(species_type) %>%
  summarize(Percent_venomous = mean(venomous.poisonous)) %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_col(aes(y=Percent_venomous,x=species_type,fill=species_type))+
  labs(title="Species that are Venomous",
       x="Class Type",
       y="Percent of Venomous Species", fill = "Species") +
    theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -25, hjust = 0))
```
